AI Overview
A typical
.gitignore file for a Flask project is primarily a standard Python .gitignore file with a few common additions specific to the Flask project structure, such as the instance folder. 
You can create a .gitignore file manually in your project's root directory and add the following patterns: 

# Python
# Byte-code files
*.pyc
__pycache__/

# Environments
.venv/
env/
venv/
myenv/
ENV/

# Flask instance folder (contains config and database)
instance/

# IDE files (example for VS Code)
.vscode/

# Editor backup files
*.swp
*~

# Misc
.coverage
htmlcov/
dist/
build/
*.egg-info/

# specific to pipenv, if used (uncomment to ignore)
# Pipfile.lock 

# specific to poetry, if used (uncomment to ignore)
# poetry.lock

# specific to pdm, if used
.pdm.toml
__pypackages__/
